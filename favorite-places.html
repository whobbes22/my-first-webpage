<h1 style="color:gold">Places that I would like to vist:</h1>
<p>The first of many would be the:</p>
<p style="font-size: 50px;" >Pyramids:</p>
<img src="img/3 pyramids.jpg" alt="A picture of 6 pyramids ">
<p>These pyramids are made up of triangles that have 3 sides each, There is a also 3 small pyramids and 3 large pyramids. Alas if only there was 3 medium sized pyramids that would be 3 sets of 3!</p>
<h2>The <strong>Tri</strong> Cities:</h2>
<img src="img/tri cities.jpg" alt="A picture of the tri cities">
<p>As one can imagine going to the 3 cities in Washington sate is a package deal. Instead of going to 1 city you actually visit 3. That is going to 3 places instead of 1 what a great deal.</p>
